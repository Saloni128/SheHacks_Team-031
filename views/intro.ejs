            <strong>We all know how important it is to invest money in the right avenues to grow wealth. Stock market investment
            is one such lucrative option that has rewarded steadfast investors with high returns over the years.
            However, to gain the maximum out of a financial instrument, it is essential to know about its workings.
            Let’s get back to the basics and learn how the stock market works in India Read on!
            The stock market is an avenue where investors trade in shares, bonds, and derivatives. This trading is
            facilitated by stock exchanges, which can be thought of as markets that connect buyers and sellers. Four
            participants are involved in the trading of shares in the Indian stock market.</strong>
           

           <ul> <p><strong>1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI): </strong>SEBI is the regulator of stock markets in India and
            ensures that securities markets in India work in order. SEBI lays down regulatory frameworks were exchanges,
            companies, brokerages, and other participants have to abide by to protect investors’ interests.</p>

           <p><strong>2. Stock exchanges: </strong>The stock market is an avenue where investors trade in shares, bonds, and derivatives.
            This trading is facilitated by stock exchanges.In India, there are two primary stock exchanges on which
            companies are listed.<ul>
            <li>Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) – Sensex is its index</li>
           <li> National Stock Exchange (NSE) – Nifty is its Index</li></ul></p>

            <p><strong>3. Stock brokers/brokerages:</strong> A broker is an intermediary ( person or a firm) that executes buy and sell
            orders for investors in return of a fee or a commission.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Investors and traders:</strong>Stocks are units of a company’s market value. Investors are individuals who
            purchase stocks to become part owners in the company. Trading involves buying or selling this equity.</p>
            


</ul>

          </p>
          To understand how to share market works, the next thing is to learn about primary and secondary markets
            ust keep this small concept in your mind:
            <p><strong>When the demand for shares is more than supply, price rises.
            When the demand for shares is less than supply, price falls.</strong></p>
            The Indian stock exchanges, BSE and NSE, have algorithms that determine the price of stocks on the basis of
            volume traded and these prices change pretty fast. So this is how the stock market works in India. There is
            definitely more to it however this is a good starting point to develop further understanding.
