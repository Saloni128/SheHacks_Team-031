                    <p>
                        <h3>DO's</h3>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Start by virtual stock market investing app on mobile or try out a stock investing desktop
                        application before trying the stock market. These virtual apps are useful for practice before
                        making an actual stock market investment.</li>
                        <li>You should invest ample amount of time for doing research on the stock you want to buy. Buy
                        shares when they are at a lower price and try to understand the stock pattern.</li>
                        <li>Even if you have a small amount of money, start investing early as you can take good advantage
                        of compounding from an early stage.</li>
                        <li>Diversify your investment. Investing in various sectors lowers your chances of loss.
                        Invest most of your money in the blue chip companies. They give you low returns but lowers your
                        risk of loss.</li>
                        <li>Keep yourself up to date with the latest news of the company you are invested in.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Don’ts:</h3>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Don’t wait for the perfect time to enter into the stock market, as there is no perfect time.
                        Start as early as possible.</li>
                        <li>Don’t get carried away with the speculations, initial profits and buzz.
                        The trading fees should be less than 2%. Otherwise, it can eat up your profit.</li>
                        <li>Don’t invest more than your capacity and always set a budget for investing.</li>
                        <li>Don’t be greedy, try to figure out the right time to sell your stock.</li>
                        <li>Don’t get carried away and invest all your money in a particular stock. You may face a huge
                        loss.</li>
